# Web Recorder Server
Web Recorder is an automated website testing and monitoring service that checks for problems with your website or application. It carries out operations in a browser, the same way a user would, to ensure that everything is working properly. More information about Web Recorder functionality and it's API can be found [here][ducumentation].

Web Recorder's Server consists of two parts: Frontend for the visual representation of tests and Backend for the automation tests logic.
